# Princeton Walking

Welcome to the Princeton Walking Repositiory

## Goals
The goal of this repo to answer a basic question from the Mayor:

<i> Not sure if all the info would be ready in time to make this work, but I'd love to be able to say that x percentage of residents live within a 10 minute walk of a park or open space. Is it possible to build a program using the GIS data that would calculate that? If so, that would be a great planning tool! </i>
